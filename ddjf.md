- Our club's motto is Mind and Hand,which mean that you are required to use both your hands and minds to archieve something.
# Below are some information of our club that you might want to know.
(1) Our clubs will not going to have any members who are lazy and do not want to serve.

(2) I always say one thing: If we dont strive for the best, why should we even exist? 

(3) Guess what,our club had been the most active and impactful club this few years. I couldn't imagine the consequences if the new generations,which are you guys,did not do well to preserve our clubs. The consequences may be very big. ~~i would even get back from Singapore to scare you guys~~
